	abstract = "In heterogeneous computing systems, there is a need for solutions that can cope with the unavoidable uncertainty in individual task execution times, when scheduling DAGs. When such uncertainties occur, static DAG scheduling approaches may suffer, and some rescheduling may be necessary. Assuming that the uncertainty in task execution times is modelled in a stochastic manner, we may be able to use this information to improve static DAG scheduling considerably. In this paper, a novel DAG scheduling approach is proposed to solve this stochastic scheduling problem, based on a Monte Carlo method. The approach is built on the top of a classic static DAG scheduling heuristic and evaluated through extensive simulation. Empirical results show that a significant improvement of average application performance can be achieved by the proposed approach at a reasonable execution time cost."

	abstract = "Mixed-machine heterogeneous computing (HC) environments utilize a distributed suite of different high-performance machines, interconnected with high-speed links, to perform different computationally intensive applications that have diverse computational requirements. HC environments are well suited to meet the computational demands of large, diverse groups of tasks. The problem of optimally mapping (defined as matching and scheduling) these tasks onto the machines of a distributed HC environment has been shown, in general, to be NP-complete, requiring the development of heuristic techniques. Selecting the best heuristic to use in a given environment, however, remains a difficult problem, because comparisons are often clouded by different underlying assumptions in the original study of each heuristic. Therefore, a collection of 11 heuristics from the literature has been selected, adapted, implemented, and analyzed under one set of common assumptions. It is assumed that the heuristics derive a mapping statically (i.e., off-line). It is also assumed that a metatask (i.e., a set of independent, noncommunicating tasks) is being mapped and that the goal is to minimize the total execution time of the metatask. The 11 heuristics examined are Opportunistic Load Balancing, Minimum Execution Time, Minimum Completion Time, Min–min, Max–min, Duplex, Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Simulated Annealing, Tabu, and A*. This study provides one even basis for comparison and insights into circumstances where one technique will out-perform another. The evaluation procedure is specified, the heuristics are defined, and then comparison results are discussed. It is shown that for the cases studied here, the relatively simple Min–min heuristic performs well in comparison to the other techniques."

	abstract = {Summary Multi‐core architectures comprising several graphics processing units (GPUs) have become mainstream in the field of high‐performance computing. However, obtaining the maximum performance of such heterogeneous machines is challenging as it requires to carefully off‐load computations and manage data movements between the different processing units. The most promising and successful approaches so far build on task‐based runtimes that abstract the machine and rely on opportunistic scheduling algorithms. As a consequence, the problem gets shifted to choosing the task granularity, task graph structure, and optimizing the scheduling strategies. Trying different combinations of these different alternatives is also itself a challenge. Indeed, obtaining accurate measurements requires reserving the target system for the whole duration of experiments. Furthermore, observations are limited to the few available systems at hand and may be difficult to generalize. In this article, we show how we crafted a coarse‐grain hybrid simulation/emulation of StarPU, a dynamic runtime for hybrid architectures, over SimGrid, a versatile simulator of distributed systems. This approach allows to obtain performance predictions of classical dense linear algebra kernels accurate within a few percents and in a matter of seconds, which allows both runtime and application designers to quickly decide which optimization to enable or whether it is worth investing in higher‐end graphics processing units or not. Additionally, it allows to conduct robust and extensive scheduling studies in a controlled environment whose characteristics are very close to real platforms while having reproducible behavior.

	abstract = {Abstract A ‘standard task graph set’ is proposed for fair evaluation of multiprocessor scheduling algorithms. Developers of multiprocessor scheduling algorithms usually evaluate them using randomly generated task graphs. This makes it difficult to compare the performance of algorithms developed in different research groups. To make it possible to evaluate algorithms under the same conditions so that their performances can be compared fairly, this paper proposes a standard task graph set covering many of the proposed task graph generation methods. This paper also evaluates as examples two heuristic algorithms (CP and CP/MISF), a practical sequential optimization algorithm (DF/IHS), and a practical parallel optimization algorithm (PDF/IHS) using the proposed standard task graph set.
