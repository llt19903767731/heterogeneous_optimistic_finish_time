Hi there,

The only issue I can see since the paper submission concerns reference number 14. The link at the end is missing the visible "https://" at the start and seems to default to "http://" instead, which no longer directs to the correct address when clicked - i.e., the link should read/be

https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01538516/file/KUMAR_SURAL_2017.pdf   

which is the correct address, but in the proof it reads as just

tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01538516/file/KUMAR_SURAL_2017.pdf 

and the hyperlink itself seems to be using the http:// prefix instead of https:// so doesn't work. I'm not sure what the cause of this issue is but it isn't apparent in, for example, the downloadable pdf for the paper on Easychair which was compiled at submission.

In addition, there are two typos I have found since the original submission (see below). Would it be possible to correct these at this stage? I understand if this is not possible of course.

The typos in question, and the corrections, are:

1. The last line of page 4 reads "assumption THAT it once may have been". The second word should be "than" instead.

2. The last line of the 2nd paragraph on page 5 starts with "c_ij(P, C) from GPU to CPU"; the capital P in the parentheses should be a capital G - i.e., "c_ij(G, C)".   

Again, I understand if you can't correct these now - fortunately they aren't critical, just annoying! 

All the best,
Tom McSweeney
